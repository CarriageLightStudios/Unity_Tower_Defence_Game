# Unity Tower Defence Game

## Overview

This game aims to cross the genres of Tower Defence/City Building with the fast action and replayability of a rougelite.

## Plot

You arrive on an alien planet under the contract of (unnamed corporation). You are tasked with getting resources and sending them back to the corporation. If you fail to provide the corporation with what the demand of you they will live you to be buried by an ever unhospitible planet.

### Goals

With this game I hope to learn a great deal of skills in 3D game design while also doing something fun along the way. I hope to release something playable on my itch.io page soon.
